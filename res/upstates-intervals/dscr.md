# Quality control of intervals separation
Figures in quality control folder show the quality control of upstate definition and some statistics of obtained upstates. The filtered data figures show some parts of time series with raw and filtered data overlayed. It is visible that the filtering preserved the main feature of low frequency behaviour. Same images with upstates also provide some intuition on what was defined as upstates. Histograms show what was the typical upstate/downstate duration. 

# Spectral properties of upstates and downstates
Figures in spectral properties folder show the spectral properties of upstates and downstates. One figure show the power spectrum density of signal intervals (upstates and downstates), the other one show the 2d histogram of power and central frequency of detected peaks in PSD. The peaks are detected using [FOOOF model](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/index.html). Additionnaly, there are supportive figures that show more or less the same thing and finally barplot shows the mean power in beta band for upstates and downstates. All these figures show that during upstates the power in beta band is higher than during downstates.
