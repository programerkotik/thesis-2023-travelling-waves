Sampling rate: 20000 Hz, Raw data format: ncs. Data were filtered for line noise (60 Hz). 
Data were saved as .npy files: 
- ts_filtered_probe1 contains the filtered data of the first probe, 
- times_probe1 contains the corresponding timestamps, 
- ts_filtered_probe2 contains the filtered data of the second probe, 
- times_probe2 contains the corresponding timestamps, 
- ts_filtered_ecog contains the filtered data of the ecog, 
- times_ecog contains the corresponding timestamps.
More information about raw data can be found in the dscr.md file in the raw directory.
