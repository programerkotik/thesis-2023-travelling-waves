This folder contains spontaneous recordings obtained from the visual cortex of a cat using the [idw](https://neo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/io.html?highlight=ibw#neo.io.IgorIO) file format. The data was collected from the suprasylvian cortex, a specific brain area.
### Experimental Setup
- ECoG Array: The recordings were performed using a 64-channel ECoG (Electrocorticography) array.
- CSD Probes: Additionally, two 16-channel CSD (Current Source Density) probes were used.
1. Probe 1: This probe is a 64-channel surface array.
2. Probes 2 and 3: These probes are 16-channel linear arrays that span the depth of the cortex.

For more information on the data format and how to access it, please refer to the provided [idw documentation](https://neo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/io.html?highlight=ibw#neo.io.IgorIO).
