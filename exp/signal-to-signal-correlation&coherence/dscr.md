## ECoG-Probes coherence
In this experiment I used signals from ECoG and probes I and II to analyse the correlation and coherence between them. Before analysis data were preprocesses using the following steps:
1. Filtering: I used a bandstop filter to remove line noise.
2. Filtering: I used a bandpass filter with a passband of 0.1-100 Hz.
Processed data were saved in the folder `data/processed` and the code used for preprocessing is in the file `preprocessing.py`.
