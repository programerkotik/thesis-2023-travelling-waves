This experiment includes a preprocessing step to get upstate regions in ECoG-generated data. Since the signals from different ECoG channels are similar, upstates are defined based on the behavior across all channels. Upstate intervals are identified in the low-pass filtered data using a thresholding method. The mean and standard deviation of each channel determine the threshold value. Obtained data about upstates are also used later in other experiments. 

Additionally, I explore the spectral properties of a signal during upstates.
